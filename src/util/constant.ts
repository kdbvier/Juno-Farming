export const readme = "JunoFarming wants to be a community driven project.This means that anyone inside the project is free to express their ideas.We want to build something solid with you, which allows everyone to trade while making money.The first step is to trust us, through the sale, the trading of the first NFT collection.How it works?When the first mint is done , the buyer will be able to stake the NFT.The staker then will take from the second mint 50% of price.Now then the second one is able too to stake the NFT , then when the third mint is done the first and the second staker will take 50% of price of the third NFT,that means 25% for the first one and 25% for the second one.So will work until all NFT are sold.When then the collection we be sold out every stakers will earn from the trading in the marketplace with the same system.But pay attention if you didn't staked your NFT you will not be able to earn, and also if you will make an unstake of your NFT.Other important thing is that every buyer will be able to stake up 20 NFT , more NFT you stake more you will earn.20 nft is the maximum a person can have in the walletSecondly we would like to create a second nft collection, and the first 500 stakers of the first one will receive 1 nft of the second collection for free!Who up to that moment has not staked or has entered late will then have to buy the nft of the second collection.As already mentioned it is a community driven project, so come forward and propose your ideas and we will realize them together!"
